# Super Fiesta: Party Picture Processor

A Python tool that transforms your party photos into perfectly square formats optimized for social media platforms like Instagram.

## What it does

Super Fiesta takes your party pictures and:
- **Resizes them into perfect squares** (1080x1080px) with colored backgrounds
- **Preserves aspect ratios** by centering images within the square
- **Batch processes** entire folders of images
- **Filters by macOS tags** (optional) to process only selected photos
- **Maintains high quality** with customizable JPEG compression

Perfect for event photographers, party organizers, or anyone preparing photos for social media!

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python ppp.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** to configure your settings and select folders

## How to use

### First run
The script will ask you to configure:
- **Image size**: Percentage of the square to fill (default: 95%)
- **Background color**: RGB values like `100,0,180` (purple)
- **JPEG quality**: 1-100 scale (default: 95)
- **Tag filtering**: Use macOS Finder tags to select specific photos

### Subsequent runs
Your preferences are saved automatically. The script will only ask for:
- **Source folder**: Where your original photos are located
- **Output folder**: Where processed photos will be saved

### macOS Tag Filtering
If enabled, only photos tagged with your specified tag (default: "To Publish") will be processed. This is perfect for marking specific photos in Finder before batch processing.

## Key Features

âœ… **Smart resizing** - Images are proportionally scaled to fit perfectly within squares
