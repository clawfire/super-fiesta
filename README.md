# Super Fiesta: Party Picture Processor

A Python tool that transforms your party photos into perfectly square formats optimized for social media platforms like Instagram.

## What it does

Super Fiesta takes your party pictures and:
- **Resizes them into perfect squares** (1080x1080px) with colored backgrounds
- **Preserves aspect ratios** by centering images within the square
- **Batch processes** entire folders of images
- **Filters by macOS tags** (optional) to process only selected photos
- **Maintains high quality** with customizable JPEG compression

Perfect for event photographers, party organizers, or anyone preparing photos for social media!

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Virtual Environment (Recommended)

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv super-fiesta
   
   # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
   source super-fiesta/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows, use:
   # super-fiesta\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python ppp.py
   ```

4. **When finished, deactivate:**
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

### Option 2: System-wide Installation

1. **Install dependencies globally:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python ppp.py
   ```

### Why Use Virtual Environments?

Virtual environments isolate your project dependencies and prevent conflicts with other Python projects. This is especially important for:
- **Avoiding dependency conflicts** between different projects
- **Ensuring consistent behavior** across different machines
- **Easy cleanup** - just delete the folder to remove all dependencies

## How to use

### First run
The script will ask you to configure:
- **Image size**: Percentage of the square to fill (default: 95%)
- **Background color**: RGB values like `100,0,180` (purple)
- **JPEG quality**: 1-100 scale (default: 95)
- **Tag filtering**: Use macOS Finder tags to select specific photos
- **Watermark settings**: Logo/image overlay with position, size, and opacity controls
- **Batch renaming**: Choose from multiple naming patterns for organized output

### Subsequent runs
Your preferences are saved automatically. The script will only ask for:
- **Source folder**: Where your original photos are located
- **Output folder**: Where processed photos will be saved

### macOS Tag Filtering
If enabled, only photos tagged with your specified tag (default: "To Publish") will be processed. This is perfect for marking specific photos in Finder before batch processing.

### Watermark System
Add your logo or branding to processed images:
- **Support for PNG images** with transparency for professional results
- **Flexible positioning**: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, or center
- **Adjustable size**: 1-50% of image width
- **Opacity control**: 10-100% transparency
- **Margin settings**: Distance from edges (0-100 pixels)
- **Automatic scaling**: Watermarks resize proportionally to maintain aspect ratio

### Batch Renaming System
Organize your processed images with intelligent naming patterns:
- **Original**: Keep original filenames (default behavior)
- **Sequential**: Clean numbered sequence (e.g., `Party_001.jpg`, `Party_002.jpg`)
- **Event-based**: Include event name and date (e.g., `Birthday_2024-01-15_001.jpg`)
- **Customizable options**: Set your own prefix, date format, and number padding
- **Conflict detection**: Warns about existing files and asks for confirmation
- **Renaming preview**: Shows exactly how files will be renamed before processing
